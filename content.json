Actually I’ve been thinking about lots of things these days, like right now the sentence in my head is: so much are lost during translation. (That’s just because I’ve been watching Emily in Paris and Emily said that, no other meanings lol) But for crying out loud, what is there to feel? I haven’t had a serious crush on anybody, since maybe 2021, and my friends circle stays approximately the same as 2020. I hang a lot with old acquaintances, not bothering to meet anyone new. Sometimes I felt stuck here, doing something I never truly loved, yet have decided to keep doing for probably the rest of my life. I need a change, but I know that change does not come from the environment or the stage that I am in. I can change anytime, even right now theoretically. But I’m not sure if I still can bring about changes to myself. I used to be constantly changing, recreating myself during different life stages that I was in - in that case, it’s actually that I reinvent myself every time I enter a new school. I felt satisfied, and maybe a little sorry for my ‘past lives’ that I’ve chosen to throw away. But it turns out I’ve grown up pretty well thanks to that. But I know that I’ve stayed the same for at least 4 years. I still haven’t out-grown that 17-year-old me. Maybe I know things better now, but I have the same fears, I don’t have many new friends, I still hate sports, I can’t decide on what I truly like, and I didn’t find love. I used to be older than my real age, but now I feel like I’ve been left behind. This is the true sad story. Can’t wait to really feel like a 20-year-old.","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Diary | Happy events","slug":"Diary-Happy-events","date":"2023-04-13T10:12:57.000Z","updated":"2023-04-13T16:26:05.738Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/04/13/Diary-Happy-events/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2023/04/13/Diary-Happy-events/","excerpt":"","text":"Just ate an ice-cream and went back to dorm holding a box of chicken chips (Bing says its real name is popcorn chicken, but whatever) bought by a best friend (I wouldn’t mention her real name here for privacy reasons but, Love her!!).

Actually I played game on my iPad for like 4 hours before going for a shower. I hate myself. (No I don’t.) I left half an episode of Emily in Paris unwatched, but I’m not watching that today. No I am not. I will not. I will go to bed as soon as I finish this. So some happy events: I recieved the email from school confirming my payment - so it went well after all.

Mom and dad completed the payment to TUd which I mentioned yesterday, and now I owe them so much that I doubt I can ever pay back. Feeling crazy for not choosing the 100% fee waiver option. Well but good things happen, too. I went to this k-pop ‘running’ event with a friend and spent a whole lot of good time there sitting on the damp grass. We were crazy, well at least I am.

I mean IT, my personal blog&#x2F;website. When I was building this yesterday (constantly referring to a step-by-step blog that is), I started planning for the contents I display on these pages. I wish to record&#x2F;share (though I doubt anyone would bother reading all these) my life, my thoughts and my experience, yet in an non-personal way. I wanted to publish my diary yet at the same time preserve what little the internet has spared for my privacy. I wanted this to be my public diary. I’ll try to nurture a habit of writing something down each day. It is interesting that I express myself more freely and somehow more precisely in a foreign language - maybe because I have been talking to myself in English ever since I was a child. Anyways, I will try to nail down a topic or a particular event for my daily record. I swear to be as honest and unerroneous as possible, but sometimes double-checking every sentence is way too much work. To anyone reading this (which I’m assuming is NOBODY), please just bear with me ;) And finally about today: As we all know, I’ve been planning on studying abroad for a long time - That’s absolutely not true, ‘cuz I actually started madly planning and preparing last fall (August if my memories are correct, but wait, is memory countable??). So after sending out hundreds of application letters and cvs, I finally recieved several offers, starting March and ending depressingly yet not at all surprisingly with a rejection from ETHz. (I mean, ETHz? I should be good enough for a Phd to dream for an offer! But if I WAS good enough, then why bother?) Have to admit that I felt so huge a sense of success and achievement when I opened a letter from A! announcing a full tuition fee waiver, that I almost immediately started dreaming about completing my degree there. Well, after some consideration (like a whole week, maybe more), I decided on TUd after all. Alert! : None of the above contains the key point I’m making today. The key point is that I recieved the payment letter today. Like, 4 pm. I panicked. You see the main concern here is that, although I thought I was prepared for the cost of my 2 years abroad, I was not ready with the ‘real’ transfer of money. Or with the future prospectives, salary wise. And here are the cold truth: I will spend 33k Euros each year (minimum) for 2 years, and IF I may get my degree on time, I recieve an income of 3500 per month before tax. So how much after tax, you may ask? Just 2500. And I will spend (at least) almost 1500 on living expenses. That will leave me living like a nearly homeless woman on the streets of Netherlands!!! I mean, not able to pay for my own house and all. And it would take me like, 5 years to pay back my parents for how much I spent during the years 2023-2025. And another thing, if I choose to look for a job in Germany as I originally planned, I would have to 1. learn German self-taught while handling the so-called devilish courses in my programme, and 2. pay even more tax for every single Euro I earned through my occupation. They said you need to look at the brighter side of the picture and I did, the time I can spend after work and all. But I really don’t see it as bright as before - when I still dreamed of earning a lot of money. Then they would say that you look too far ahead, why not just stare at the road in front of you. I also did. I spent like an hour searching the internet on how to make transfer to a foreign bank. THE PAYMENT methods, the high commission charges and the exchange rate just added up to my anxieties. Also I started to worry that, what if I can’t find anyone out there? I mean a close friend, someone I can trust and rely on in emergencies. What if I hate it out there? I mean I can get depressed because of the hedious weather. I started to understand my mom for having those panic attacks about me going abroad all on my own. Sometimes I know that things would figure themselves out as time goes by, yet still I worry. But somehow I feel better once I’ve written these down. There’s a, like, 3 minutes’ delay between me pushing this article to my repository and the site displaying it, so I will leave this here for a while before checking on and rereading it. – for like a hundred times.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Diary","slug":"Diary","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Diary/"}]},{"title":"K-Pop Review | EXO'CLOCK","slug":"K-Pop-Review-XOXO-Repackage","date":"2023-04-10T09:27:08.000Z","updated":"2023-04-12T09:31:21.666Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/04/10/K-Pop-Review-XOXO-Repackage/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2023/04/10/K-Pop-Review-XOXO-Repackage/","excerpt":"","text":"想到写这一篇其实是因为，前两天EXO11周年fm，在微博刷到了很多古早地曲；咆哮这种就抛开不讲，偶然又听到了我一直很喜欢，但如果特意去想却不会想到的歌。 歌名叫做Lucky。 是没有mv的一首歌，好在有几场比较高清的舞台——没有编舞的那种，只是几个人在台上走来走去，唱唱歌挥挥手。 去年年底又翻到这首歌的舞台，看了之后突然很感动，在微博打了几句话不知道怎么表达，最后进了草稿箱： 12345歌曲是能够承载记忆的：粉色泛着亮光的舞台，confetti落在头发上，手比出L是lucky也是EXOL。关于我们降落在同一个星球这件事。 今年再次看到，同样的一群人老得老胖得胖，还有韩国水光肌的加持，所有人都不太好看——至少和当年相比。 好吧，至少唱歌是有进步的。至少有些人有进步。 有进步的人还有我：虽说早年听过这首歌的中文版，但这回靠自己听懂了一部分歌词还是很让人激动的——学习有用。 나 착하게 살아서 그래 一定是因为我善良地生活，才会这样幸运！","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Review | 朱自清","slug":"Review-朱自清","date":"2023-04-10T07:59:29.000Z","updated":"2023-04-10T08:00:56.283Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/04/10/Review-朱自清/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2023/04/10/Review-%E6%9C%B1%E8%87%AA%E6%B8%85/","excerpt":"","text":"23-04-07 in 新清华学堂 看完之后我一个劲地说，太会跳，太会跳，太会跳。 所以有特别喜欢的几幕，首先是第一幕，学生簇拥着老师的场景，一开场群舞这样跳让人觉得生命力太饱满了。甚至看得有点想哭。 还有三个朱自清那里，有人轻轻笑了，但我觉得那里的表现力特别好。情感特别丰满。最后一幕朱自清在绸缎的波浪里跳舞也很好看。 不太喜欢的点是背影那一幕，觉得有声和无声的切换不太优雅，有点不自然。另外那一幕的配乐是歌词浑厚的一首曲子，体感很突兀… （个人感觉是如果全剧都不要用带歌词的曲子最好了 舞美以灯光为主要的表现点，个人感觉是比较浅显的。颜色，追光，定点和全亮。每一个象征和暗示意义都很容易get，欣赏门槛并不高。贵在感情饱满，生命力丰沛，舞的力度和情感传达都非常到位。 好看！","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Review | 유열의 음악앨범","slug":"Review-柳烈的音乐专辑","date":"2023-04-10T06:13:09.000Z","updated":"2023-04-12T09:31:05.505Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/04/10/Review-柳烈的音乐专辑/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2023/04/10/Review-%E6%9F%B3%E7%83%88%E7%9A%84%E9%9F%B3%E4%B9%90%E4%B8%93%E8%BE%91/","excerpt":"","text":"其实是第二次看了，上一次还是刚追完鬼怪，那时候为了补足初恋组意难平看过，却没能如愿吃到一大口糖。反而看到最后都觉得怅然若失，不懂两个人为什么突然分开，又为什么突然释然。 这次看倒是觉得，啊就是这样，90年代的氛围，几年不见还是会挂念，会一直往没人看的信箱里写信——反倒是通讯技术发达了，却更联络不上了。 所以每一次重逢都像是命中注定。就像每一次分别那样。 “别跑了，好吗。会受伤的。” 最终还是在两个人事业都较为顺利稳定的时候再次见面了，好像也只有这样才能那样笑着。然后以笑回应。 其实觉得是oe来的，好像两个人会漫长地出现在彼此的生命里，好像无法割舍，好像无法迈步——但无法迈步的结果大概是“我们结婚吧”。 但下一次阻挠呢。下雨的人生应该怎么办才好呢，如果只有艳阳高照的时候才能体面相爱的话。下一次分离要怎么办呢。 “原来是这样的心情啊。”","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"movie","slug":"movie","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/movie/"}]},{"title":"Review | The English Patient","slug":"Review-The-English-Patient","date":"2023-04-10T05:54:17.000Z","updated":"2023-04-10T06:01:28.859Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/04/10/Review-The-English-Patient/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2023/04/10/Review-The-English-Patient/","excerpt":"","text":"we are the real countries. 刚看完，倒着回顾一下。第一个喜欢的场景是katherine在洞里写下的留言。她写在almasy的书上，好浪漫。我容易被这种虚无缥缈的表白或者说升华感动，但细想又觉得没必要。 没有久别就没有重逢：I’ve always loved you. would it be less pain this love would seem less beautiful. 说爱太容易了，说不占有也是不负责任的一种。忘记我，又爱得发狂，不占有，又嫉妒地发疯。把一切都说成爱，把要遵守的，值得维护的都放在所谓爱情之后：其实只是疯掉了。爱不是软肋，执念才是。 almasy的请求那里，我以为护士会在颤抖着打开两瓶安瓿之后停下，哭一声说，not today。不要在今天，不知道为什么，我只是觉得他不应该在那天死掉。 我以为他会被拒绝，然后一切在静止和等待中收场：还会有下一个这样的日子，总有一天护士会答应他。 可能战争已经太压抑了。可能导演觉得如果这样结局太残忍。 其实更喜欢的是护士的爱情故事。很有意思。 爱过的人都死了，所以桥下有炸弹那个情节设计非常好。他刚跑出去的时候我甚至没有意识到护士的天生buff，看到护士惊慌失措的样子也跟着非常害怕。我觉得这一次也要应验，才是不俗的故事。但看他拆弹的样子又觉得not this time，手抖了，桥上来了坦克，但这次应该能成。 结果真的成了，这里是下一个很喜欢的场景。很流畅地衔接在拆弹后面，人们欢呼着德国投降的消息，城市在狂欢，hana和一直不待见的david跳舞。下雨了，他们抬着担架四处跑着让almasy淋雨。 好像所有的眼泪都应该在这个时候流下，所有的委屈在此刻才能倾诉。我想到david的手指，在他愤怒地控诉almasy的时候，我其实并没有太共情他。但德国投降那一天却突然感受到了汹涌的委屈和痛意。 他最终还是没有杀掉男主。 雕像上面有炸弹，非常好的设计。和前面到处都是炸弹，钢琴，路边，到处都是呼应了。 再往前就不太喜欢了。尤其是护士情绪化过头地走向好友遗物的时候。I mean for gods sake，拆弹员就在你脚底下蹲着，你自己不活了不要紧，不能trigger一个地雷把人家也炸飞吧？ 最后说最后一个场景，大概是拆弹队长走的那天，两人说都会时常去那个教堂。可能会遇见的事说成总有一天，好像就变成了一定会重逢了。 然后护士笑了笑。 战争结束了，她的一生还很长，当然可以爱上好多人。","categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Hello World!","slug":"hello-world","date":"2023-04-10T05:42:06.000Z","updated":"2023-04-12T09:30:50.812Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/04/10/hello-world/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2023/04/10/hello-world/","excerpt":"","text":"This is where I store my thoughts, reviews and life experiences.
